# - 'version' and 'appname' are not essential, but are defined here as a example to show how you can
#    reference other defined symbols in strings and description files (such as licence.txt)
#    you may also define your own symbols to be used this way for convenience
# - 'apptitle' will show on application frame (if 'decorate' is TRUE) and windows taskbar
# -  default installation folder is MY_DOCUMENTS/Simcity 4/Plugins/${defaultfolder}
# - 'width' and 'height' do NOT include sidebar (if sidebar is longer than 'height', sidebar height is used)
# -  set 'decorate' to TRUE/FALSE to show/hide default application frame
# - 'splash_ms' is the time the splash message is showing, in milliseconds. If there is no "splash.jpg" file,
#    this property is ignored. The filename "splash.jpg" is hardcoded so it can be loaded while this file is being compiled.
