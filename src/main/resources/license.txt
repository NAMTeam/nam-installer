 FAILURE TO READ MAY RESULT IN CRASH TO DESKTOP SITUATIONS WHEN LOADING 
 CITY TILES.

This mod is NOT COMPATIBLE with the EA App/Origin editions of SimCity 4 Deluxe (as sold on EA.com, and also available via
EA Play and Xbox Game Pass), which feature and unpatched and unpatchable Version 1.1.610 game executable.  The NAM requires
Version 1.1.638 at the minimum, and the EA App/Origin versions cannot be upgraded to this version.  See the read-first-nam-47.html document for more details.

Additionally, if you are upgrading from a previous version of the NAM, make sure to REMOVE YOUR PREVIOUS NAM INSTALLATION FROM THE PLUGINS FOLDER FIRST.  The Cleanup/Cleanitol function is not designed at present to remove full NAM installations, and failure to remove old NAM files may cause conflicts.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The default installation of the NAM is designed for use on 64-bit operating 
 systems, and as such, requires that SimCity 4.exe be patched with the 
 enclosed 4GB Patch (4gb_patch.exe).  FAILURE TO APPLY THE 4GB PATCH PROPERLY 
 WILL RESULT IN THE GAME CRASHING TO DESKTOP UPON LOADING A CITY TILE.  Users  with 32-bit operating systems (including Windows XP) or lesser amounts of  RAM should select the "Low RAM/No RHW" option in the installer, or manually  run the Controller Compiler and install a smaller feature set.  For more   details, see the "0-read-first.html" file included in the download package.
